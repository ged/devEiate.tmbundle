# devEiate TextMate Theme

(As a vim theme):

I packaged up my Emacs theme years ago as a TextMate theme and shared it among a few friends, who converted it to themes for their editors, etc.

It's also incidentally, the theme that code in the default RDoc look and feel uses.


## Supported Editors

* TextMate
* Sublime Text 2


## Installation

Source can be viewed or cloned via Mercurial from: http://repo.deveiate.org/devEiate.tmTheme, or if you prefer Git, via the Github mirror: https://github.com/ged/devEiate.tmTheme

To install via Mercurial:

	mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles/
	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles/
	hg clone http://repo.deveiate.org/devEiate.tmbundle

To install via Git:

	mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles/

The theme should then show up in the View â†’ Theme list.
